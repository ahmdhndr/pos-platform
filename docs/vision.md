# Product Vision

## Product Name (Working Title)

Modular Offline-First POS Platform

---

## Target User

Small to medium businesses in Indonesia that:

- Operate physical stores
- Experience unreliable or intermittent internet
- Have 1–10 outlets
- Need flexibility across different business workflows

Primary initial focus:

- Retail / Fashion stores

---

## Core Problem

Most POS systems in Indonesia are:

- Cloud-first and fragile when internet is unstable
- Rigid in workflow and industry assumptions
- Difficult to extend beyond their original use case
- Not designed with strong tenant isolation or modularity

This leads to:

- Lost transactions during outages
- Operational friction
- Over-dependence on vendor-specific workflows

---

## Product Promise

A reliable, offline-first, multi-tenant POS platform that:

- Works fully during internet outages
- Syncs safely and predictably when online
- Adapts to multiple industries through modular design
- Scales from a single outlet to multi-outlet businesses

---

## What We Optimize For

1. Reliability over feature count
2. Offline usability as a first-class concern
3. Clear tenant isolation and security
4. Modular, extensible architecture
5. Predictable behavior over hidden magic

---

## What We Explicitly Do NOT Build (for MVP)

- Full accounting system
- Payroll / HR management
- Marketplace / ecosystem platform
- AI-based analytics
- Complex loyalty or CRM systems

---

## Success Definition (MVP)

A store can:

- Operate all day with no internet
- Complete sales without data loss
- Sync transactions reliably when connectivity returns
- Manage products and inventory across outlets
